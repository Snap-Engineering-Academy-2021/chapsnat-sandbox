# Unity by Snap

Description:
This application is a design-focused prototype of "Unity by Snap", a Snapchat feature I pitched to Snap's Chief Communication Officer, Julie Henderson. Unity is focused on educating users on racial injustices and connecting them to non-profit organizations that can help them make a difference.
